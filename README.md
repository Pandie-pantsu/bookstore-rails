# Bookstore (kinda)

This is the start of another web design project using Rails.

The plan at the moment is to create a website to showcase an author's current books.
Everything is subject to change and this is currently not just a show case on their writing but on my coding skills as well.

So for the love of butter, please don't scream at me if I make a mess lmao.
